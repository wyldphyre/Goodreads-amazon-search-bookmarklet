Goodreads Amazon Search Bookmarklet
===================================

Searches on Amazon for the book you are viewing on goodreads.com

The current implementation just does a simple search of a the title and first author on the amazon.com.au website.

You can easily customise the amazon site for your own country if you wish to use it.

## TODO
- Alert the user if running the bookmarklet on a page other than a Goodreads book page.
